This is a term project of Istanbul Kultur University CSE5001 Web Programming (2023-2024 Fall). That contains all backend services (business API and authserver, both of which have a multi-layer architecture implemented with a repository pattern) 
and one MVC (it was mandatory to use it; we are only using it for the wiev layer).
