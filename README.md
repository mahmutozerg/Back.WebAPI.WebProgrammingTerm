This is a term project of Istanbul Kultur University CSE5001 Web Programming (2023-2024 Fall). That contains all backend services (business API and authserver, both of which have a multi-layer architecture implemented with a repository pattern) 
and one MVC (it was mandatory to use it; we are only using it for the view layer).


Known issues:

Category search doesn't work as intended when user tries to search by product name in the category search page
